# WiFit - React

For this project, I faithfully followed the layout presented in the Desktop and Mobile versions. A version of the application is available at this link: https://wefit-react-green.vercel.app/

This project consists of an e-commerce store developed in React, using the Yarn package manager and the Vite bundler. The e-commerce store was developed to evaluate the developer's ability to build a React application and use the main technologies of the ecosystem.

All the code was developed following good programming practices and using quality tools such as ESLint and Prettier.

- Vite
- React Router DOM
- Styled Components
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky
- Lint Staged
- JSON Server
